        <h1>Kerala has been struggling due to floods caused by the 
torrential rains from the past month, forcing people in many localities 
to the relief camps with no adequate food, clothing and shelter. We, the
 students of <a href="http://sjcetpalai.ac.in/">SJCET, Pala</a> in 
association with Lammara Technologies Pvt. Ltd. take an initiative to 
solve the current clean water crisis our state is facing at the moment.</h1>

        <p>Private well systems pose a potential health risk if they 
have been covered by floodwaters because this water may contain fecal 
material and other contaminants from overflowing sewage systems, 
agricultural run-off and industrial byproducts. This is going to be a 
major issue during the coming months for our state. Most of the 
population will resort to the traditional methods but what we don't see 
is the drawbacks of such methods. When you give your body water that is 
filled with toxins leached from plastic, or filled with by-products from
 chlorination, or with volatile organic compounds, or water that is 
contaminated by pesticides or hormones, you are asking your body to work
 twice as hard at detoxification, because it must first detoxify the 
water you are drinking, before that water can be used to fuel your 
organs of detoxification!<br>Clearly, the most efficient way to help 
your body both avoid and eliminate toxins is to provide your body with 
the cleanest, purest water you can find. And that may be more of a 
challenge than you think.</p>
        <p>Here at SJCET we believe in better living through better 
engineering and in light of the situation mentioned above we present you
 Terafil- Porous terracotta disc, made from red clay (pottery clay), 
sand &amp; wood saw dust, developed by Indian Institute of Minerals and 
Material Technology (IMMT), Central Institute of Plastics Engineering 
and Technology (CIPET), Bhubaneswar in association with Lamaara 
Technologies Pvt. Lmt. a startup incubated in our IEDC Bootcamp. This 
water purifier which can purify up to 30 liters of impure water within a
 few hours and make it safe for drinking with all parameter (pH, 
bacteria, turbidity, iron etc) within BIS Limits. This has been tried 
and tested in Orissa with excellent results. We have 200 units of 
Terafils readily available with us in Kerala and would like to donate 
the same to the people affected by the floods in Kerala. But our funds 
are limited and hence are the number of units we can provide.

    <p>Changanassery: On, 21st August 2018, we at LAMAARA Technologies 
along with a dedicated team of aspiring B.Tech. students were able to 
successfully deliver our first flagship product Terafil filters to the 
relief camps based at St. Mary’s Church, Parel and at St. Joseph’s 
college of communication, Media Village.
      Each one of us felt a sense of pride when we witnessed the smiles 
on the faces of those less fortunate people affected by the floods in 
Kerala. Our product delivered on its expectations as promised by 
providing the people at these camps with a reliable and trustworthy 
source of pure drinking water.
      We, at LAMAARA Technologies want to thank each and everyone of you
 who dedicated their time and effort to make this possible. A hearty 
thanks to Mr. Anto P. Biju, Mr. Thomas Cyriac, Mr. Karun Kailas, Mr. 
Deepak A., Mr. Akhil Babu, Mr. Abraham Raji, Mr. Dani Alex, Miss. Agnes 
Augustine, Miss. Elsa Cherian, Mr. Abhijith K.M., Mr. Tahseen Amin, Mr. 
Mathew Abraham, Mr. Nevin Abey Roberts and Mr. Roni K. James and to all 
those who believed in us and supported us in every possible way. 
Together we were able to be the light to the people of Kerala in these 
dark times. The words together and hardwork got us this far and it will 
take us further but to continue the good work, we need your support. 
Help us.Thank you.</p>
